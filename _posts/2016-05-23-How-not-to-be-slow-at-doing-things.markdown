Do you feel that you are slow at doing things as compare to before? or some of your friends or family members are doing things damn slow? 
Probably, your answer is *Yes*.

Well, if you are slow then you are slow for a reason. Your brain is overloaded with many things and thoughts. You are just thinking, living in imagination, processing some high amount of data, during this process your are not able to realize pace of time. Your are just unable to keep up with the pace of time. You are just absent not able to realize the presence of time. 

So how to fix that problem? Here are some tips for you.  

1. Let's caliberate your brain first. Use timer like stop watch for daily tasks, pay attention to movement of time, exercise it, that will caliberate your brain with pace of time. 

2. Now you are caliberated, let's reduce the processing load from your CPU (in this case it is your very own BRAIN). Try not to think about the things which don't matter at very moment.  

3. You got problems and you are always busy thinking and imagininng the solution for them or imagininng how the life would be if they are solved.
    - Come out of it, think logical for possible solution in real life, not in dreams or world of fantasies.
    - Once you have the list of possible options (and normally there are a few options) choose one of them that you think will solve your problem. You may ask friends to help you analysing the stuff for you. 
    - Focus on that solution, believe it and work on it. Determination is Key. Don't give up!     
4. Using #3 remove as many things as you can from CPU stake, cool it down.

5. Is there still something left? Check are they real or dreams? can be done now or no? If they are not real take them out. If you can not do anything about them in this week or month, take them out from the stake. 

6. Is there still somethings, some bits and pieces? Focus on very important thing now. 
How to determine what's most important? Think about what do you really need to do in order to move forward to the next thing for the day? For example taking shower, getting ready, going to work, focus on tasks at hand, finish up your day. Focus and work on the solution you have set plan for, focus on small bits and pieces. Believe that this will get you closer to your target. Break down bigger tasks into smaller chunks so that each can be completed in 2 hours or so. This will help you to stay motivated and focused. 

Once all this comes into your practice, you will get the rhythm, having proper focus will be part of your daily life.
