Hi! I specialize in building secure and reliable software systems using modern tools and techniques. My experience includes workflow automation, payment gateways, image processing, natural user interfaces, distributed reactive systems, scalability, performance, reliability, continuous delivery, microservices, and application monitoring. 

I have experience developing and maintaining SOC2 and PCI-compliant software systems. I have lead and developed several critical features for widely used products such as Nintex Workflow Cloud and Ezypay Subscription Payment System. 

I have experience building scalable software systems for thousands of users and implementing processes to monitor, maintain, and extend the systems. I create feedback loops that accelerate feature development and delivery with zero downtime based on CI/CD best practices. 

I am just a click away; Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/habibahmedbhutto)
