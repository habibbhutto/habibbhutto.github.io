# Yes, that's right. I'm Habib Ahmed Bhutto

I love crafting software. I'm interested in future socio-economic technological solutions to real problems. I enjoy technical challenges. For last few years I been enjoying technologies like NUI, 3D Depth Sensors, Large Mult-Touch Screens, Image Processing, Mobile, Desktop and Internet Technologies. Currently I'm fascinated with IoT and Internet Machines. 

I love writing code in C and C++, but I use C#, Java, PHP, Javascript and others as well. I like what WPF and MFC can do, but I love QT. I like SQLs but I love NoSQLs. I feel awesome when I use Open Frameworks, OpenCV and NS2. It's fun to hack open source code here and there with some purpose.
